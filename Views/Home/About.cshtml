                <strong>My Biography</strong>
            </h1>
            <p class="lead">
                I was born deaf and legally blind in Ontario, Canada and I now resides in Oklahoma, USA.
                <br />
                I was mainstreamed in an oral program in public school for Elementary school, then switched to a Deaf Institute for her High School years.
                I’m happily married with 2 adult children and works as an online ASL teacher and freelance writer.
                <br />
                I enjoy watching television and movies, spending time with family and friends (all online right now due to the pandemic), reading books, writing stories, flea marketing, and cooking.

                <strong>Teaching Style</strong>
            </h1>
            <p class="lead">
                I teach online through Zoom in a casual setting. I teach with the microphone off as ASL is a visual language and aural clues make it harder to remember the signs, otherwise we will use the chat feature to communicate.

                For my ASL lessons, I provide membership to my curriculum’s website – <a class="text-info" style="text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.asldeafined.com/" target="_blank">Asleafined.com</a>, as well as lesson handouts, videos, PowerPoints, and reading materials. You will also receive homework to complete offline in your own time – this includes activities to complete on the website, reading, watching videos, and submitting your own ASL videos, or essays.

                Please note, I do not reward CEUs or a Certificate of Completion. My lessons are geared towards personal learning only.
